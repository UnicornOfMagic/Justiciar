This is a thing that I am not sure what it's going to do. My original thought was to be some kind of extremely basic RPG engine thing that I can turn into an API to use for some kind of RPG game. Maybe start simple with just a text adventure game. Idk. Might as well put it on github so I don't lose it forever.
